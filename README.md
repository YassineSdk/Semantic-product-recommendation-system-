#### **🧠 About the Project**
- In this project, we are building a product recommendation system that steps beyond traditional methods like tag-matching or Euclidean similarity.
Instead, it leverages the power of word embeddings and vector search, two cutting-edge NLP techniques:

* Word Embedding: A technique that transforms text into dense numerical vectors, capturing the semantic meaning of words by placing similar concepts close together in a high-dimensional space.

* Vector Search: A method used to find items with the most similar vector representations, enabling efficient and meaningful retrieval of content based on context, not just keywords.

- Together, these methods allow our system to truly understand the meaning behind product descriptions, and not just compare surface-level similarities.
The goal is to enhance the recommendation experience and deliver more relevant, meaningful suggestions by embracing the depth of textual understanding.

#### **⚙️ Workflow**
**🧼 Data Cleaning**
- Ensure consistency and significance by removing nulls, duplicates, poor-quality text, and irrelevant noise.

**📝 Text Enrichment & Analysis**
- Merge relevant columns, refine textual content, and ensure the product descriptions are rich in meaningful information.

**🔄 Data Preprocessing**
- Transform the cleaned text into a suitable format to apply embedding techniques effectively.

**🧠 Building the Recommendation System**
- Apply the embedding model, store data in a vector database, and build a powerful retrieval mechanism that returns context-aware product recommendations.
